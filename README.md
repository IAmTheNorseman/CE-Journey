# CE-Journey
This is purely to serve as a backup to my conglomeration of coding notes and projects I take and make while I progress throughout my journey of learning CE. Don't know exactly how this site works yet, but for the record, I am open to feedback 100%.
I aim to learn just enough CE to apply it in conjunction with an education in the botanical side of biology with the goal of getting into botanical engineering. The future is green!
